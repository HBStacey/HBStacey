- üëã Hello my name is Howard, 
- I am new to the GitHub community. It was recommended by someone that I follow on both YouTube and on LinkedIn to make 
- an account as this could prove beneficial to my studies.
- 
- üñ• I‚Äôm currently learning Linux, but not just Linux in general. I am studying to become a Linux System Administrator. 
- Including:    -RHEL   -Ubuntu   -CentOS 
- 
- üö∂‚Äç Ô∏èThe Journey thus far:
- 
- Since June of 2000 I started my Linux journey by exploring the many roles of a Linux System Administrator. Though Linux was 
- not my first choice in I.T. I did take a few courses that intrigued me during my time in Cisco's CCNA program. 
- I originally went to college to become a Windows System Administrator. I studied the material, worked on labs, and participated
- in online sessions for CompTIA A+ (Professor Messer). Over the years I struggled to find an entry level position fresh out 
- of college that included a basic requirement of 5 plus years of experience.
- 
- As time went on, I started to evaluate my career and narrow down what exactly I wanted to do in I.T. Things were not clicking for me
- at the time, so I started looking back at some of my old notes when I took an intro to Linux course back in college. I noticed
- that some of the commands that I learned with PowerShell were not to different from the commands I used in Linux. Curiosity got the
- better of me and I decided to take it one step further and install Ubuntu on Oracles VirtualBox. I was honestly confused on what to 
- do the moment I had it installed. I didn't know where to begin. I was presented with a GUI and no knowledge of where to start. 
- 
- After playing around with Ubuntu, I started looking up "how to" videos on how to navigate the OS. During my research I came across a 
- YouTube channel by the name of LearnLinux.tv. The very first tutorial I remember clicking on was "Navigating the File System". The 
- video was very well detailed, easy to follow, and overall made learning Linux fun. From there I started to watch more videos of the 
- course of time. Basic file editing, moving and renaming files, and checking resource usage. The more I watched the easier it became
- to understand the material. Eventually I took aim at learning RHEL as it came up in my studies. Sure enough, this same channel has a
- complete tutorial on CentOS. 
- 
- The technologist that I follow as I continue down this path is Mr. Jay LaCroix. A Systems Architect who puts so much care and effort into 
- every video that he uploads. He has made learning not only fun, but easy to understand for those just starting out. And that has given me
- a passion to continue learning Linux. I am not afraid to admit that I don't know everything. I am willing to research and learn the material.
